# geog351-finalproject

Repository for the final project of my intermediate level geographical statistics class at McGill (GEOG 351).

Both the [final paper](https://rpubs.com/legallyahc/geog351_final_paper) and [final presentation](https://rpubs.com/legallyahc/geog351_final_pres) are available virtually. Beware, these are class assignments (not to a publication standard, but an example of some work that I am proud of). I ultimately got an 87% ("A+"!) on it.
