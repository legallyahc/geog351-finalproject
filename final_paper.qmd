## Introduction

This paper ventures to investigate the links between education, mode of transportation to work, and Maori status to multiple deprivation in New Zealand. Greater active transportation to school has been linked to higher rates of material and social deprivation in Quebec [@cutumisu2014]. Thus, I believe that greater use of active transportation (such as cycling and public transit use) will be linked to a less deprivation. Furthermore, increased car usage can indiciate a greater lever of affluence (due to the money required for maintenance and gas), leading to my prediction that greater private car usage will lead to lower deprivation. In the literature, deprivation is typically used as a predictor of educational attainment, rather than education determining deprivation [@cooper2003; @shuttleworth1995]. However, I believe that education and deprivation exhibit a positive feedback (i.e. as educational attainment decreases, material deprivation increases, which decreases educational attainment), and thus chose to investigate to what degree educational attainment influences deprivation. In New Zealand, ethnic-density of Maori has been shown to have a protective effect on health, but this is concealed by the impact of the higher rates of deprivation that Maori experience [@bécares2013]. I wanted to confirm the close link between Maori status and deprivation already established in the literature as well as see if this could be mitigated by education and mode of transportation. With my focus on mode of transport, education, and Maori status, I would like to see how well they predict deprivation and which predictors are most influential. As deprivation is often spatially autocorreleated, I will investigate if this holds for New Zealand [@bécares2013].

## Methods

### Data sources

```{r IMD18}
#| collapse: true
#| output: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "IMD data import code."
library(tidyverse)
imd18 <- readxl::read_excel("IMD2018.xlsx", sheet = "IMD18") # Import data
```

The 2018 New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is a weighted index of deprivation as determined by measures of employment, income, crime, housing, health, education, and access as seen in [@fig-IMD] [@exeter2018]. Each observation is a "Data zone", which corresponds to the 2013 New Zealand Census Unit, and ordinal level data displaying the relative rank among all Data zones. It contains variables for ranking by each of these measures and different computations of the IMD that exclude each category (e.g. the IMD without any of the education inputs). For my study I chose to use the Index of Multiple Deprivation that excluded educational data to maintain independence among my variables. It contains 6181 unique observations.

```

::: aside
New Zealand uses a unique method of classifying education attainment, with a 7 level certificate / diploma system. I compiled this information to be as comparable as possible to the Canadian system of "Secondary", "Some University", "Bachelors", "Graduate", and "Post-graduate". I also combined these to make variables that combined any university experience and any university degree past a Bachelors.
:::

To answer my research questions linking education, mode of transport, and Maori status to deprivation, I used data from the 2018 New Zealand Census at the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) geographic level [@statsnz2020]. Unfortunately, the SA2 zones are larger than the Data zones of the IMD, with the census data having 2254 unique entries.

```{r setup}
#| collapse: true
#| output: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Spatially joined data import code."

analysis <- read_csv("data.csv") %>% 
  select(RnkIMDNoEd, No_qual, Maori, Drive_priv, Bus, Masters_, AnyUni, Bicycle1) %>% 
  rename(
    Bike = Bicycle1
  )
  # Import spatially joined data
```

To combine these two data sources, I used a spatial join in ArcGIS Pro with the *greatest overlap* method, joining the census data to the IMD. This resulted in some of the resulting entries having the same census data variables, but unique deprivation values, which lead to inherent spatial correlation among these census variables. This resulted in 6181 different observations in the final dataset.

### Variables

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Response**

`RnkIMDNoEdu`: Ranked index of multiple deprivation that was made without education data (Ordinal).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Predictors**

`No_qual`: % of people with no proof of education (Ratio).

`AnyUni`: % of people who have any university education (Ratio).

`Master_`: % of people with post-bachelor's education (Ratio).

`Maori`: % of people with Maori heritage (Ratio).

`Drive_priv`: % of people who drive their own vehicle to work (Ratio).

`Bus`: % of people who take the bus to work (Ratio).

`Bike`: % of people who bike to work (Ratio).
:::
:::

Only `No_qual` and `AnyUni` appear to be normally distributed, with `RnkIMDNoEdu` uniformly distributed, `Master_` right skewed, and `Drive_priv` left skewed (see @fig-notransform). While I would use a Shapiro-Wilk test to confirm their lack of normality, it is invalid for samples with $> 5000$ observations.

`Bike`, `Bus`, and `Maori` appear to have a logistic distribution and were thus transformed.

```{r log transform}
#| collapse: true
#| output: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Logistic transformation code of `Bike`, `Bus`, and `Maori`."
analysis <- analysis %>%
  mutate(
    log_maori = log(Maori),
    log_bus = log(Bus),
    log_bike = log(Bike)
  )
  # Logarithmic transform on some variables
```

After this transformation, `Bike` and `Maori` appear more normally distributed, while `Bus` has a very large number of values at one point and is otherwise uniformly distributed (see @fig-transform).

### Analysis methods

All relationships will be investigated through a Spearman correlation and a multiple linear regression model, with the potential spatial correlation of multiple deprivation in New Zealand investigated through Moran's I and, if significantly related, evaluated in a spatial multiple linear regression model.

#### Spearman Correlation

The Spearman Correlation is a non-parametric test of correlation, requiring only that each sample is independent from each other. It accepts Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio level data. It will be run on each predictor variable and the response variable to assess the predictors' correlation to the response and any potential collinearity. I also used Bonferroni p-value correction to correct the significance value of any of the many comparisons I made.

#### Multiple Linear Regression

The relationship between the variables will then be investigated with an Ordinary Least Squares multiple linear regression, with the predictor variables determining the response. This assumes that the relationship is linear, the predictors are normally distributed, there is no collinearity among the predictors, the residuals are homoskedastic, and the residuals are normally distributed. We can ignore the requirement of normality for the predictors due to the large number of observations and will test our assumptions after the model.

#### Moran's I

Moran's I investigates the spatial autocorrelation of a variable, with a positive value indicating positive spatial autocorrelation. For this dataset, `RnkIMDNoEd` will be investigated due to its lack of duplication of variables and to answer our initial research question.

#### Spatial Multiple Linear Regression

The final multiple linear regression model will be run in GeoDa using a Queen weights to test the significance of spatial lag and spatial error. If both are significant, the more significant test will determine the model to be run. For a spatial lag model, this means that a spatially significant lag of our result variable is added to our predictors. For a spatial error model, any potentially spatially dependent errors are resolved.

## Results and discussion

Here you develop, in turn, your hypotheses rela5ng to the data, present the results (output tables and graphs) and describe your conclusions or each hypothesis. Deal with each hypothesis fully, in turn, and in some logical sequence. Before you present the results and your interpretation for any test, you should describe each particular hypothesis (which variable are involved in that hypothesis , what is the predicted sign(positive or negative) of effects, etc, what is the test, what does the output tell you?). Then move on to next hypothesis, etc. All graphs, tables and figures should be numbered, referenced in the appropriate place in the text and placed in appendix. You should also include a discussion of post-estimation diagnostics and actions to be taken if basic assumptions are violated. Appendix pages for all graphics are not limited: do not shrink and cram too many plots and output tables per page.

### Spearman Correlation

```{STATA}
#| collapse: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "STATA Spearman Correlation command."
spearman rnkimdnoed no_qual drive_priv log_bus masters_ anyuni log_maori log_bike, stats(rho obs p) bonferroni
```

The results of the Spearman correlation are visible in @fig-spearmancorr. As we can see from the STATA output, the comparison is limited by the number of observations in `log_bus` (4669 observations). Every corresponding correlation is significant at the 95% confidence level aside from `log_maori` and `log_bike`. However, `AnyUni` and `Master_` have a Pearson correlation of more than $0.9$ with `No_qual`, which indicates that these variables are likely autocorrelated. As `No_qual` has the greatest correlation with `RnkIMDNoEd`, it will preserved while `AnyUni` and `Master_` are excluded from further analysis.

::: aside
After a logistic transformation any zero values receive a value of $-\infty$ and were thus excluded from analysis.
:::

From our Spearman correlation, we can conclude that a higher rate of no of educational qualifications is related to a higher rate of deprivation, while a greater amount of any university education is correlated to a lower rate of deprivation. Somewhat confusingly, any amount of university education is more correlated to a lower rate of deprivation than only those with a graduate degree or beyond (Spearman correlation coefficient of $-0.5622$ to $-0.5244$). Maori status is significantly related to a higher rate of deprivation with a coefficient of $0.6945$. In contrast to my original hypothesis, greater modal share of driving a private vehicle to work is related to a higher rate of deprivation (coefficient of $0.3521$). Active transportation (in the form of riding a bike or taking a public bus) is linked to lower rates of deprivation, with the log transform of these variables having a correlation coefficient of $-0.0472$ and $-0.0792$ respectively.

### Multiple Linear Regression

#### Models

```{STATA}
#| collapse: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "STATA Multiple Linear Regression commands."
regress rnkimdnoed no_qual drive_priv log_bus log_maori log_bike, beta
regress rnkimdnoed no_qual log_bus log_maori log_bike, beta
regress rnkimdnoed no_qual log_bus log_maori, beta
```

The initial regression model is visible at @fig-ols1. Here, both `Drive_priv` and `log_bike` are not significant, though `Drive_priv` is more so, and was thus excluded from the next model, visible in @fig-ols2. As `log_bike` still has an insignificant p-value, and was excluded. The final model, visible in @fig-ols3, has an adjusted $R^2$ of $0.6156$ and a $\sqrt{MSE}$ of $1118.6$. I believe that this is a reasonable model for an ordinal response variable, with a relatively high $R^2$ though the $\sqrt{MSE}$ is rather high because of the uniformly distributed response variable.

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
| Predictors  | Beta Coefficients |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `no_qual`   | 0.4358954         |
| `log_bus`   | 0.3789292         |
| `log_maori` | 0.5379429         |

:::
::: {.column width="5%"}

::: {.column width="50%"}
We can now consider the combined influence of mode of transport, educational attainment, and Maori status on deprivation. Maori status has the greatest effect on deprivation with a $\beta$ coefficient of $0.54$, while a lack of educational qualifications is still influential with a $\beta$ coefficient of $0.44$. Bus ridership to work, while less important, is influential with a $\beta$ coefficient of $0.38$. Unlike the Pearson correlation, however, an increase in bus ridership is related to a greater rate of deprivation in the linear regression model.

#### Assumptions

```{STATA}
#| collapse: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "STATA Multiple Linear Regression assumption analysis commands."
rvfplot
estat hettest
vif
```

Even before testing our assumptions made of our multiple linear regression model, we already know that our data was not normally distributed prior to our analysis. This is confirmed by the Residuals vs. Fitted plot ([@fig-rvf]), which has a strong negative linear trend due to the uniformity of the response variable.

However, the variance of the residuals must also be assessed. Using a Breusch--Pagan/Cook--Weisberg test for heteroskedasticity, we reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity and affirm that the residuals are heteroskedastic ([@fig-hettest]).

We can confirm that there is no autocorrelation between our variables by checking the Variance inflation factors (VIFs) of each independent variable ([@fig-vif]), where the greatest value is $2.18$ for `No_qual`.
