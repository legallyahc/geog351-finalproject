# Background

## Background: Data

My project focuses on the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which was created in 2013 and updated in 2018, which is a ranking of deprivation by data zones in New Zealand [@exeter2018].

I also used data from the 2018 New Zealand Census at the statistical area two level, focusing on education qualifications, typical methods of travel to work, and Maori heritage [@statsnz2020].

## Background: Index weighting {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r IMD Data, echo=TRUE}
imd18 <- readxl::read_excel("IMD2018.xlsx", sheet = "IMD18") # Import data
ncol(imd18) # Number of columns
nrow(imd18) # Number of entries
```

-   6180 entries (excluding the column names' row)
-   these are at the different geographic level than census data
-   only 15 real variables, with duplicates

## Background: Census wrangling {.smaller}

```{r Census code nonsense, echo=TRUE}
# Necessary for importing data nicely
library(tidyverse)

# Importing and cleaning education data
education <- read_csv("2018-census-place-summaries-csv/2018-census-place-summaries-education-table2-2018-csv.csv") %>%
  filter(Area_type == "Statistical Area 2")
education <- education %>%
  filter(Maori_ethnic_group_indicator_summary_description == "Total") %>%
  select(Year, Area_type, Area_code, Highest_qualification_description, Highest_qualification_percent) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Highest_qualification_description, values_from = Highest_qualification_percent) %>%
  select(!c(`Not elsewhere included`, Total))

# Importing and cleaning ethnicity data
ethnicity <- read_csv("2018-census-place-summaries-csv/2018-census-place-summaries-ethnicity-table1-2018-csv.csv") %>%
  filter(Area_type == "Statistical Area 2")
ethnicity <- ethnicity %>%
  select(Year, Area_type, Area_code, Maori_descent_description, Maori_descent_indicator_percent) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Maori_descent_description, values_from = Maori_descent_indicator_percent) %>%
  select(!c(`Response unidentifiable`, `Not stated`, `Total`))

# Cleaning transport data, spitting out the percentage of modes used for work, selecting SA2
transport <- read_csv("2018-census-place-summaries-csv/2018-census-place-summaries-transport-table1-2018-csv.csv")
transport <- transport %>%
  select(Year, Area_type, Area_code, `Main_means_of_travel_to_work_description`, `Main_means_of_travel_to_work_percent`) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = `Main_means_of_travel_to_work_description`, values_from = `Main_means_of_travel_to_work_percent`) %>%
  filter(Area_type == "Statistical Area 2") %>%
  select(!c(`Did not go to work today`, `Not elsewhere included`))

# Binding the census data together
vars <- left_join(education, ethnicity, by = "Area_code") %>%
  left_join(., transport, by = "Area_code")
vars <- vars %>%
  select(!c(Year, Year.y, Area_type.y, Area_type.x, Area_type)) %>%
  rename(
    `Total Education` = `Total stated.x`,
    `Year` = Year.x,
    `Total Ethnicity` = `Total stated.y`,
    `Total Transport` = `Total stated`
  )

# Creating groupings for education
vars <- vars %>%
  mutate(
    Secondary = as.numeric(`Level 1 certificate`) + as.numeric(`Level 2 certificate`) + as.numeric(`Level 3 certificate`) + as.numeric(`Overseas secondary school qualification`),
    `Some University` = as.numeric(`Level 4 certificate`) + as.numeric(`Level 5 diploma`) + as.numeric(`Level 6 diploma`),
    Tertiary = as.numeric(`Bachelor's degree and level 7 qualification`) + as.numeric(`Post-graduate and honours degrees`),
    `Post-tertiary` = as.numeric(`Master's degree`) + as.numeric(`Doctorate degree`),
    `Any University` = as.numeric(`Level 4 certificate`) + as.numeric(`Level 5 diploma`) + as.numeric(`Bachelor's degree and level 7 qualification`) + as.numeric(`Post-graduate and honours degrees`) + as.numeric(`Master's degree`) + as.numeric(`Doctorate degree`)
    ) %>%
  select(!c(`Level 1 certificate`, `Level 2 certificate`, `Level 3 certificate`,
            `Level 4 certificate`, `Level 5 diploma`, `Level 6 diploma`,
            `Bachelor's degree and level 7 qualification`, `Post-graduate and honours degrees`,
            `Master's degree`, `Doctorate degree`))

```

::: notes
-   Looks worse than it is.
-   Filtering a lot of big data into something usable: percentage values by SA2 of % Maori, % Highest level of education, and % Mode of transport to work.
-   Gets written to a .csv for more horrors.

## Background: Census wrangling

And this is where a lot of problems that have been building come to a head.

. . .

2013 Census Areas $=$ 2013 IMD Data zones

. . .

2018 Statistical Area 2 $\neq$ 2018 IMD Data zones

. . .

2018 Statistical Area 2 $<$ 2018 IMD Data zones

::: notes
In 2018, Census New Zealand reclassified their census districts to be better equipped for the modern age of data, resizing their census areas into *census mesh blocks*, *statistical area one*, and *statistical area two*. The IMD is based on the old 2013 census standard and provides a key for *statistical area one*, not *statistical area 2*, which is bigger than the IMD blocks.
:::

## Background: Census wrangling

::: incremental
-   Imported SA2 Boundaries, census data, and IMD18 data to ArcGIS Pro
-   Education, Ethnicity, and Transport data was joined to the SA2 Boundaries
-   Using a spatial join (greatest overlap), census data was joined to the IMD18 data.

# Methods

## Methods: Ordinal data

The IMD is a form of ordinal level data. Each data zone is ranked 1:6181, with a rank of 1 indicating the lowest deprivation and 6181 the highest. Thus, to investigate the data I primarily used methods that accepted ordinal data but did use it in a linear regression.

## Methods: Hypotheses {.incremental}

-   There will be greater deprivation with less education qualifications

    -   And the inverse, that there will be less deprivation with more education qualifications

-   There will be less deprivation with greater private car and bicycle use

-   There will be more deprivation with greater bus use

-   There will be greater deprivation in areas of greater Maori ethnicity

## Methods: Variables {.smaller}

To avoid an inherent correlation between the predictors and the response variable, I chose to use the Index of Multiple Deprivation that excludes education data.

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Response**

`RnkIMDNoEdu`: Ranked index of multiple deprivation that was made without education data.
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Predictors**

`No_qual`: % of people with no proof of education

`AnyUni`: % of people who have any university education

`Master_`: % of people with post-bachelor's education

`Maori`: % of people with Maori heritage

`Drive_priv`: % of people who drive their own vehicle to work

`Bus`: % of people who take the bus to work

`Bike`: % of people who bike to work

## Methods: Normality

```{r Scatter plot matrix}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| message = FALSE,
#| warning = FALSE,
library(GGally)
analysis <- read_csv("data.csv")
analysis <- analysis %>% 
  mutate(
    log_maori = log(Maori),
    log_bus = log(Public_b_1)
  )
analysis %>% 
  select(RnkIMDNoEd, No_qual, Maori, log_maori, Drive_priv, Bus, log_bus, Masters_, AnyUni, Bicycle_1) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

::: notes
Get the matrix from Geoda: pretty :)
:::

## Methods: Spearman Correlation {.smaller}

```{r spearman}
spearman <- analysis %>% 
  select(RnkIMDNoEd, No_qual, log_maori, Drive_priv, log_bus, Masters_, AnyUni, Bicycle1) %>% 
  cor(method = "spearman")
```

![](Screenshot%20from%202023-04-04%2020-30-16.png){fig-align="center" width="442"}

Pearson correlation coefficients, which range from $1:-1$.

```{r significance spearman}
#| echo = FALSE
symnum(spearman)
```

The significance level of each Pearson correlation is notated at the bottom.

## Methods: ?Hypotheses

<p style="text-align: center;">

$H_0$: `RnkIMDNoEdu` is not predicted by the selected variables

$H_a$: `RnkIMDNoEdu` is predicted by the selected variables
