# Background

## Background: Data

My project focuses on the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which was created in 2013 and updated in 2018, which is a ranking of the deprivation of by data zones in New Zealand [@exeter2018].

I also used data from the 2018 New Zealand Census at the statistical area two level, focusing on education qualifications, typical methods of travel to work, and Maori heritage [@statsnz2020].

```{r IMD Data, echo=TRUE}
imd18 <- readxl::read_excel("IMD2018.xlsx", sheet = "IMD18") # Import data
ncol(imd18) # Number of columns
nrow(imd18) # Number of entries
```

-   6180 entries (excluding the column names' row)
-   these are at the different geographic level than census data
-   only 15 real variables, with duplicates

# Binding the census data together
vars <- left_join(education, ethnicity, by = "Area_code") %>%
  left_join(., transport, by = "Area_code")

    `Total Ethnicity` = `Total stated.y`,
    `Total Transport` = `Total stated`
  )

# Creating groupings for education

            `Level 4 certificate`, `Level 5 diploma`, `Level 6 diploma`,
            `Bachelor's degree and level 7 qualification`, `Post-graduate and honours degrees`,
            `Master's degree`, `Doctorate degree`))

```

::: notes
-   Looks worse than it is.
-   Filtering a lot of big data into something usable: percentage values by SA2 of % Maori, % Highest level of education, and % Mode of transport to work.
-   Gets written to a .csv for more horrors.

## Background: Census wrangling 

And this is where a lot of problems that have been building come to a head.

. . .

<p style="text-align: center;">
2013 Census Areas = 2013 IMD Data zones
</p>

. . .

<p style="text-align: center;">
2018 Statistical Area 2 $\neq$ 2018 IMD Data zones
</p>

. . .

<p style="text-align:center;">
2018 Statistical Area 2 $>$ 2018 IMD Data zones
</p>

::: notes
In 2018, Census New Zealand reclassified their census districts to be better equipped for the modern age of data, resizing their census areas into *census mesh blocks*, *statistical area one*, and *statistical area two*. The IMD is based on the old 2013 census standard and provides a key for *statistical area one*, not *statistical area 2*, which is bigger than the IMD blocks.

## Background: Census wrangling {.incremental}
:::{.incremental}
- Imported SA2 Boundaries, census data, and IMD18 data
- Education, Ethnicity, and Transport data was joined to the SA2 Boundaries
- Using a spatial join (greatest overlap), census data was joined to the IMD18 data.

# Methods

## Methods: Ordinal data

The IMD is a form of ordinal level data. Each data zone is ranked 1:6181, with a rank of 1 indicating the highest deprivation and 6181 the lowest. As there are many of these ordinal ranks, I choose to treat it as ratio level data for the purpose of statistical analysis.
